# Object_Detector

Program to use the Pi camera to detect objects using OpenCV's pretrained object detection library.

Huge thanks to Core Electronics for comming up with most of the code: [https://core-electronics.com.au/guides/object-identify-raspberry-pi/](url)

I had to modify this code to work with the Picamera2 module since the cv2 camera was not working on my raspberry pi 5.

Files and Install instructions can be found in the article linked above, some of the commands have been updated and will no longer work, especially if you are running on different hardware.
